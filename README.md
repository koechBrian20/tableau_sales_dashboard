# tableau_sales_dashboard
*this was a case study where i was dealing with a dataset of an ecommerce company that sells health-concious products for people and their pets.

*first I had to create the data model by using relationships between the fact table and each of the dimension table ensuring that the correct cardinality was used,before proceeding to individualing creating the visuals that i would use to populate my dashboard.

*When it came to finally creating the dashboard, i preffered a floating layout due to the ease in fitting the visuals.

*I also had to keep in mind the company's branding thus the use of the green and blue on the visuals.

*As a way of adding interactivity to these dashboards, I used a parameter to enable the user to choose which measure to display in the line chart between gross revenue and profit which then would filter the bar and scatter charts.

*In the performance by region dashboard I used a floating container to show or hide the treemap/lollipop charts. lastly I used a parameter action to use the map visual as a filter on the other visuals.
